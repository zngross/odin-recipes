        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Make the meat filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
            <li>Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Make the potato topping</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.</li>
            <li>Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.</li>
            <li>Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assemble the pie</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 (or 7x11) inch baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.</li>
            <li>If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesnâ€™t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
