        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken breast with rosemary and lemon rub served with mushrooms and potatoes.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 lb small red-skinned potatoes; quartered</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary plus 1 tablespoon leaves</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic; smashed</li>
            <li>1 pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Juice of 2 lemons; save squeezed halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 chicken breasts; 6 to 8 oz each</li>
            <li>10 oz cremini mushrooms; halved</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Cover the potatoes with cold water in a saucepan and salt the water. Bring to a boil over medium- high heat and cook until tender, about 8 minutes; drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Pile the rosemary leaves, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt and the red pepper flakes on a cutting board, then mince nd mash into a paste using a large knife. Transfer the paste to a bowl. Stir in the juice of 1 lemon and the olive oil. Add the chicken and turn to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, cover and cook until the skin browns, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken; add the mushrooms and potatoes to the skillet and drizzle with the juice of the remaining lemon.</li>
            <li>Add the rosemary sprigs and the squeezed lemon halves to the skillet; transfer to the oven and roast, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is crisp, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
